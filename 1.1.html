=== What is Front End Web Development? ===

The process of writing code...

The process of writing code that tells a browser what to do.

(Browsers are pieces of software that display websites and web applications, so...)

The process of writing code that tells a browser how a website or web application should look and behave.

(More precisely...)

The process of writing the code that a browser then parses and renders into a website or web application.

=== When We Say 'Code', We Mean ====

Browsers understand three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

They each play a different role, and they work together to create a website or web app.

We'll be learning all three.

Get excited.

=== (By the way) Front End = Client Side ===

"Back end" development is writing code that tells a server what to do.

A browser is also called a client. So sometimes front-end development is called client-side development.

So you may also hear front-end development referred to as client-side development.

Some clients:

Desktop: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer
Mobile: [lots of browsers]

=== Your Project ===

I've been saying both 'website' and 'web application' because they're both projects web projects.



=== What Does The Process Look Like? ===

Web Project Flow: There isn’t one standardized process for web development. But if we had to 
pull apart a general flow, we could say that there are three phases of any web project:
• plan
• design
• develop
These three phases may occur one after the other (waterfall method). Or they could overlap in an 
iterative, more incremental approach (agile method). Or it could turn out to be some combination 
of the two methods - ultimately the method you choose will depend on the team and the project.

=== Roles ===

Web Project Roles: A web project could have anywhere from one to over one-hundred people 
working it with various roles. We've boiled that so that we can focus on four creative roles that 
should be present in every project: User-Experience, Information Architecture, Visual Design and 
Development. On a bootstrapped project with limited resources, these four roles might all be one 
person; on a larger project, working with an agency and a larger budget, each of these four roles 
could be an individual person, or a team of people.

1. User-Experience (UX) - A broad term used to describe the planning strategy for a web site. The 
UX person deals with the brand experience, and decisions regarding the most important elements 
that go into a site.

2. Information Architecture (IA) - The role of the IA expert is to organize the site's information. 
Have you ever been on a website and felt frustrated because you can't seem to complete what 
you thought was a simple task? Chances are the site you were struggling with needed the 
attention of an Information Architect. The main deliverables that come out of this stage include: 
wireframes, flow diagrams, and a sitemap.

3. Visual design - The layout of your pages, sometimes this will be done with full page template 
layouts, or sometimes this can just be a style guide where the designer makes assets for all the 
buttons, headings, image borders etc. 

4. Development: The front-end developer takes the visual design and marks up the content using a 
mixture of HTML and CSS, and works works with JavaScript to add behaviors and functionality. 
The backend developer adds the "business logic" to the website which helps solve problems like, 
"what happens after a new user fills out the registration form?"

Additional roles may include: content strategy, project manager, business analyst, usability, 
security, analytics, quality assurance, and server administrator.

Extra Suggestion: Use a real world example from your own experience and discuss how each of 
the above steps were executed.
